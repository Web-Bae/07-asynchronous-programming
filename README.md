# Module 7 - Asynchronous Programming

## Instructions

### Coding Assignment

1. Fork this repository -> You now have a copy in your Github account
2. Open with Github Desktop and clone to your local machine -> you now have a copy on your personal computer
3. Open with VS Code
4. Open a terminal session in VS Code
5. Run `npm install` -> this installs the project dependencies
6. This module is split into multiple lesson files. Use `npm run test:local-#` where `#` is the number of the lesson you want to run. For example, to run the first lesson, run `npm run test:local-0`. To run the second lesson, run `npm run test:local-1`, and so on.

### Webflow Project - Quotes Basic CRUD App with Xano

1. Watch the video to code along and build out a basic app in Webflow using Xano as a backend.

## Solutions

1. All solutions are in the `solutions` branch of this repository. To view the solutions, switch to the `solutions` branch (bottom left VS Code).

### What to do if you don't see the `solutions` branch?

1. If the `solutions` branch is not visible in the branch dropdown, you may not have included it when you forked the repo. To add it, follow these steps:
2. In the Source Control sidebar (three circles connected by lines icon), you can click on the "..." (more options) button.
3. Click on "Fetch" to fetch all branches from your fork.
4. Once the fetch is complete, you can switch between branches using the branch switching feature in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window. You may be able to see remote branches there, including branches from the original repository.
